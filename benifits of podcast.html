                      <p>Podcasts have a wonderful ability to help people feel less alone by providing a sense of connection and understanding.

                        <p>Whether it’s through podcasts that explore mental health, personal journeys, or societal issues, the power of shared stories, and the comforting presence of a 
                          podcast host and their guests, create a space where listeners can find companionship, support, and a reminder that they are part of a larger community.</p><br>
                        <p>I have found great peace in many podcasts as they have helped me feel less alone in my daily struggles as someone with bipolar disorder about to enter their 30s. You can find some of my favorite mental health podcasts in this post.</p><br>
