      <p>Launching a podcast can feel overwhelming if you're doing it by yourself, but you don't have to do it alone.
        <br> Since 2009, we have helped over 300,000 podcasters launch their podcast, and we have used everything we have learned to create this guide.</p>

          <li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Find Your Podcasting App</li>
          <p>To start, you could just download a podcast directly to your computer as an mp3 file and listen to it through your Media Player.  But there’s a better way.  The most common way to discover all the podcasts that you want to listen to and keep them organized is a podcast app.  You likely already have one installed on your phone.  
            iPhone users will have the Apple Podcasts app.  Android users can play podcasts through the Play Music app.  Beyond that, there are many other downloadable
             apps to choose from.  Some cost a little but a lot of them are free.  I did a search for “podcast player” in the Apple App Store.  I stopped counting the results after I hit 100. Here are just a few of the most popular:</p>
         <br>
             <ul type="circle" style="color: rgba(100, 148, 237, 0.948);">
              <li>Apple Podcasts</li>
              <li>Spotify</li>
              <li>Stitcher</li>
              <li>Amazon Music</li>
              <li>RadioPublic</li>
              <li>Overcast</li>
             </ul>
             <br>
        <li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Download or Stream</li>
        <p>You have found either a show, or host, or topic you are interested in.  Now it’s time to start listening. There are two ways to listen:
           download or streaming. When you download the show to your device, you will be able to listen to the entire show without interruption 
           whether you have wi-fi or cellular service or not. Listening this way allows you to enjoy your shows wherever you want to.  Most podcast apps have settings 
           where you can delete the episode from your phone once it is finished or if you can delete the episode manually. 
           You can also stream a podcast episode using wi-fi or a cellular connection.  If you listen to podcasts frequently you could end up using a lot of data this way. </p>
          <br>
           <li style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;"> Follow and Subscribe</li>
            <p>If ill not take long for you to find a podcast that you want to listen to regularly.
                You will hear podcasters use the terms “follow” and “subscribe” so you donot miss an episode. 
                 When you “follow” a show, new episodes are automatically downloaded to your device so it is ready for you to listen to within minutes of being published so the
                  next time you open your ap the latest episodes are ready for you to listen to.  Subscribing, if you are on an Apple device, is a way for you to receive premium content.  When you subscribe to shows and channels,
                   you support creators and unlock premium experiences.  Because, until recently, these terms have been used interchangeably (and are still by a few apps).  Yes, it’s a little confusing, so just remember 
              that you pay to “subscribe” but “follow” for free.</p>

           <li style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Develop a podcast concept</li>
           <p>Choosing the right podcast concept for your new podcast is a big part of attracting the right listeners and staying committed to your show. </p>
      <p> Follow these tips to narrow your niche and clarify your message. </p><br>
         <p style="color: cadetblue; font-size:25px">Define your goals</p> <br>
          <p>Why do you want to start a podcast? It’s important to know your why, even if it’s to have fun with friends.</p> <br>
          <ul> <p>Some good reasons for starting a podcast are: </p>
            <li> to generate leads for a business</li>
            <li>be recognized as an industry leader</li>
            <li>share an important message</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Podcasting has a lot of benefits for brands and businesses, but it’s important to be realistic about your goals.
            While some podcasters shoot to fame, most have a small target audience that they build over time.</p>
            <br><br>  <p style="color: cadetblue; font-size:25px">Pick a podcast theme or topic</p>
           <br> <p>You should feel excited to regularly discuss and research your podcast topic. The more you enjoy your topic, the less likely you'll experience podfade.
            Once you have some ideas, do some market research to survey the competition in your genre.
            Search your show's topic in Apple Podcasts. Listen to a few episodes and ask yourself what you could do differently.
            There’s always a unique angle or perspective to offer.</p>
         <br>
            <li>Choose your podcast format</li>
            <p>Your format should complement your podcast and feel sustainable.

              Ask yourself what gives you energy. Do you love connecting with podcast guests, or do you feel your best going solo?
              If you choose to have cohosts, try to keep your group small. Podcasting with more than two or three people makes scheduling a challenge.
              Keep in mind that some shows require more production than others. For instance, fiction podcasts usually require more editing than interview podcasts.</p>

             <h1 style="font-size: 35px ; color:blue">5 Tips to make your podcast artwork stand out</h1>  <br>
              <p>Follow these five tips to make artwork that stands out in podcast directories and attracts new listeners.</p> <br>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>Visually communicate the subject of the podcast</li>
              <p>  Potential listeners should know what your podcast
                   is about just by looking at your artwork. Too much symbolism or ambiguity can turn people away.
              </p> <br>
                <li>Design for a variety of sizes.</li>
              <p>You will use your artwork across several mediums and platforms, so it must look good even at 55 x 55 pixels.
              </p> <br>
                <li>Don’t use too many words or fonts</li>
             <p> Don't use more than four words on your cover art, and make sure it's legible even in small sizes. You should also limit 
              yourself to two complementary fonts.
            </p> <br>
                <li>Avoid podcast imagery.</li>
               <p>  Just as movie covers don't have pictures of DVDs and TV sets, your podcast cover art shouldn't show podcasting equipment. 
                  You don’t need to remind people that they’re listening to a podcast!
               </p> <br>
                <li>Use consistent branding.</li>
              <p> Your podcast artwork is a part of your overall branding. Feel free to make subtle changes to artwork
                   to fit various layouts and pages, but the imagery should stay consistent.
              </p> <br>
              </ol> <br><br>
